# LLM‑ILLS  
**LLM‑Powered Impromptu Language‑Learning Scripts**

---

## 🎯 What is LLM‑ILLS?

LLM‑ILLS is an open-source framework that converts **any textual input**—articles, reports, domain-specific documents—into **high-impact audio drill scripts** generated by LLMs and informed by evidence-based learning principles (spaced recall, active retrieval, contextual embedding).

Rather than flashcards or translation lists, LLM‑ILLS delivers **multi-turn conversational drills** with deliberate pauses designed to compel learner responses and reinforce vocabulary within meaningful contexts.

## 🧩 Core Pipeline

1. **Keyword Extraction**  
   Filters domain-relevant vocabulary using novelty and frequency rules.

2. **Contextualizer**  
   Associates each word with existing or synthetic example sentences.

3. **Script Generator**  
   Uses LLM (prompt-engineered or fine-tuned) to produce structured drills:
   - **Intro**: Tutor prompts vocabulary → `<pause_xxs>`
   - **Repeat**: Learner responds → `<pause_yys>`
   - **Extend**: Tutor prompts usage or synonyms

4. **Validator & Calibrator**  
   Enforces:
   - 3-turn structure per word  
   - Correct pause tags (e.g., `<pause_3s>`)  
   - No direct translations—only context-based prompts

5. **Formatter**  
   Serializes into **JSON** or **SSML** for use in TTS or playback UIs.

## 🎙️ Audio Production

LLM‑ILLS supports two main audio production methods:

### A. **Voice Chat API (e.g., ElevenLabs)**
- Feed **SSML** enriched scripts into TTS.
- Use `<break time="3s"/>` to generate authentic pause silences.
- Can produce natural pacing with synthesized voices and configurable cadence settings.

### B. **Studio Recording with Human Voices**
- Convert SSML drill into **studio recording scripts**:
  - Primary **Narrator Voice** reads tutor turns.
  - **Voice actors** read learner turns (silences or dummy responses).
  - Editors insert real pauses following the `<pause>` markup.
- Produce **audio masking tracks** for lab-style production:
  1. Narrator track  
  2. Learner track (silent or scripted)  
  3. Combined mix with intentional silences for recall

This dual approach supports both scalable TTS and premium human audio experiences.

## 📊 Data & Timing Foundation

Lessons are informed by a dataset with:
- **Turn labels**: `[INTRO]`, `[REPEAT]`, `[EXTEND]`  
- **Pause durations** (in seconds)  
- **Vocabulary density metrics** (~10 words / 8 minutes)

These priors ensure pacing and structure align with retrieval science.

## 🚀 Roadmap

| Phase | Goal | Deliverable |
|------|------|-------------|
| **0** | Data Bootstrapping | Annotated dataset (50–100 vocab drills) |
| **1** | Script Prototype | LLM-generated script for 1–2 vocab items |
| **2** | Pipeline Build | Full automated flow: input → script → formatted output |
| **3** | Audio Prototype | Generate TTS and/or studio-track drills |
| **4** | Pilot Evaluation | Measure learner recall (immediate & 24h) |
| **5** | Scale & Open Release | Domain-tuned pipeline + community docs |

## ✅ Validation & QA

- **Script-level validation** ensures each word receives:
  - A 3-turn drill  
  - Proper pause tags  
  - Contextual usage only

- **Audio checks**:
  - For TTS: verify SSML tags are honored  
  - For studio: timestamp pause regions for editing/mixing

- **User testing** compares AI-generated vs. human-recorded audio for recall performance.

## 📥 Contribution & Collaboration

We’re seeking collaboration on:
- **Annotated script examples** with human-voice recordings  
- **SSML & prompt templates** for enhanced pacing  
- **Studio-ready scripts** integrating pause markers  
- **Validators or playback UI prototypes**

Help build a rigorous, community-powered tool for retrieval-based language learning.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

LLM‑ILLS operationalizes **scientific audio pedagogy at scale**, offering both automated (TTS) and professional (studio) audio tracks with pedagogically informed pauses and dialogue—far beyond passive audio or flashcards.
